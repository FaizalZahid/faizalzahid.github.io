                <p class="entry">Assalamualaikum and <strong>peace</strong> be upon you!<br><br>This is my first blog on this website. I was thinking of creating this blog as a language-learning journal when I saw this video on YT:</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUrIgcrUMbY?si=yMKx_XhPA9A6f-fz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>The title "How & Why You Should Track Your Language Learning" made me think of journaling like I've done in the past which were more to general things like what happened or what event I attended.
                <br><br>Since I'm doing Japanese kanji practice livestream on TikTok (since February this year), why not blogging about it? Besides strengthening my memory, I can actually track and see the progress I made throughout this journey.
                <br><br>Let's see some progress on new Kanji characters today:
                <br>秒 (byou) = second
                <br>順番 (junban) = order/sequence
                <br>計算 (keisan) = calculation
                <br>平均点 (heikinten) = average score/point/mark
                <br>電卓 (dentaku) = calculator
                <br><br>Ah by the way, 電卓 is actually the abreviation of 電子(式)卓上計算機 (dentakushi (shiki) takujou keisanki). I was actually wondering about the table kanji (卓) and why is calculator an "electric table". That was when I asked Sonia, my AI livestream assistant, and she answered: </p>
                <img alt="Sonia AI answering that calculator is flat like a table" src="../../../img/flat.png">
                <p>Then I went to HiNative and found the abbreviation explanation. Phew!
                <br><br>I think that's it for this entry. またね~ 👋</p>
