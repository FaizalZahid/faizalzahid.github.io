			<title>The Way of Life</title>
			<link>https://faizalzahid.pages.dev/blog/2024/Oct/01.html</link>
			<description>Assalamualaikum and <strong>peace</strong> be upon you!
            <br/><br/>Tuesday. Finished Duolingo Japanese Kanji Section 4, Unit 8: <b>Discuss religion</b>
            <br/><br/>No wonder the title is "The Way of Life". Based on the Arabic word for religion:
            <br/><br/><strong>ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ</strong>
            <br/><br/>which "the way of life" suits more than the word "religion" (from Latin "religi≈ç" meaning piety/superstition/conscientinousness), at least the modern sense of religion.
            <br/><br/>So let's dive into the kanji that we have learned since 28th September 2024 (took us 4 nights to finish this!)</description>

			<description>Assalamualaikum and <strong>peace</strong> be upon you!<br/><br/>Thursday. Continuing the same unit from yesterday. <b>Reason for living</b>. Why do you think the title is called that? It's because of this:</description>
