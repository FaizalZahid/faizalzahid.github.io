		<h1>🙅‍♂️ Manifesto Against Capitalism 🤑</h1>

		<p><b>👤 We, the people, are tired of living under a system that prioritizes profit over people and planet.</b> Capitalism is a system built on exploitation – it exploits workers, communities, and the environment for the benefit of a small, wealthy elite. This system is unsustainable and unjust. It is pushing us toward climate catastrophe and widening the gap between the rich and the poor. 

		<br><br><b>🌏 But another world is possible.</b> History has shown us that <b>people have the power to overthrow oppressive systems and create a more just and equitable society.</b> The key to this transformation lies in <b>collective action</b> and <b>organized resistance</b>.</p>

				<summary>🛠 How We Will Do It ⚒</summary>
				<ol>
					<li><b>👷‍♂️ Recognize the Power of the Working Class:</b><br>We, the workers, are the ones who keep this system running. We are the vast majority, and we have the power to disrupt and dismantle capitalism. When we unite and take collective action – through strikes, boycotts, and other forms of resistance – we can force the ruling class to listen to our demands.</li>

					<li><b>👥 Build Strong Organizations and Movements:</b><br>Spontaneous uprisings are not enough. We need strong organizations and movements with clear goals and strategies. These organizations must be rooted in the working class and guided by the principles of solidarity, democracy, and inclusivity. We can learn from successful historical movements, like socialist revolutions, that emphasized disciplined organization and strategic planning alongside mass mobilization. Groups like Ende Gälende offer contemporary examples of strategic direct action combined with inclusive decision-making and relationship building.</li>

					<li><b>🏭 Seize the Means of Production:</b><br>We cannot simply reform capitalism. We must fundamentally transform the way our economy works by taking control of the means of production – the factories, farms, and resources that create the wealth in our society. By placing these resources under democratic control, we can ensure that they are used to meet the needs of the people and the planet, not to generate profits for a few.</li>

					<li><b>🧱 Build a Movement of Movements:</b><br>Our revolution cannot be achieved in isolation. We must build a broad coalition of movements – labor unions, climate justice groups, racial justice organizations, feminist collectives, and more – united in our common goal of dismantling capitalism and creating a better world.  This requires building solidarity across different identities and struggles and recognizing that our liberation is interconnected.</li>

					<li><b>⛑ Practice Solidarity and Mutual Aid:</b><br>We must reject the individualism and competition that capitalism promotes. Instead, we need to cultivate a culture of solidarity and mutual aid, supporting each other and building resilient communities that can withstand the challenges of a changing world.</li>
				</ol>

		<p><b>⏳ The time for revolution is now.</b> We cannot wait for the system to collapse on its own. We must actively work to dismantle it and build a better future in its place. We must be bold, courageous, and organized. 

		<br><br><b>☑ Join the movement. Get involved in your local community. Organize your workplace. Let's create a world where people and planet come before profit!</b></p>
